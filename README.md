# Mock eCommerce Website

This project is a mock eCommerce website built to simulate the user experience of an online store, similar to Amazon. It includes features such as product browsing, checkout, and payment success/failure pages, using mock APIs to load product data and complete the transaction process.

## Features

1. **Homepage**: Displays featured or popular products.
2. **Product Listing Page**: Showcases products in categories or lists, with filters for easy browsing.
3. **Product Detail Page**: Displays detailed information about a product.
4. **Checkout Page**: Allows users to input shipping details and view a summary of their order.
5. **Payment Success/Failure Page**: Simulates a payment transaction and shows either a success or failure page based on the randomness.
